**Spaceships Game**
Welcome to the Spaceships Game â€” a web-based game developed as part of the Web Development Environments course, assignment number 2.

***About the Project***
In this project, we built a full HTML5/JavaScript/CSS3 game from scratch.

***The game allows users to:***
- Register with username, password, and additional personal details.
- Login as a registered user or play as a guest.
- Configure game settings, such as the shooting key, game time and player spaceship design.
- Play an arcade-style shooting game where the player controls a spaceship, shoots enemy spaceships, and avoids enemy bullets.
- Earn points by shooting enemies, with different points for different enemy rows.
- Track maximum top 10 high scores across game sessions (saved in localStorage, for register users).
- Experience game music and sound effects for shooting, hits, winning, and losing.
- Restart or quit the game anytime.
- View an About modal that explains the game features.

***The site has:***
A responsive navigation menu.
A welcome page with a logo and registration/login links.
A registration page with validation (including password matching).
A login page with support for guest login.
A game configuration page.
A game page with an animated background, spaceship images, enemy ships, bullets, and a timer.

***Technologies Used:***
HTML5 for structure
CSS3 for styling, animations, and effects
JavaScript for all dynamic functionality
Canvas API for real-time game rendering
Local Storage to store users and scores

***Additional Notes for the Reviewer***
We included detailed input validation (for registration and configuration).
We implemented responsive animations and smooth transitions between screens.
We created multiple spaceship and enemy ship designs.
The game is mobile-friendly, but best viewed on desktop/laptop.
High scores are saved locally and shown on game over.
Sound effects enhance the game experience.
The game canvas has a blurred space-themed background and rounded corners for a polished look.
All code (HTML, CSS, JS) is original and written without external frameworks (only Google Fonts used for typography).
